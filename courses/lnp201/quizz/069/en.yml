question: What happens when a transaction attempt fails due to insufficient liquidity
  in the Lightning Network?
answer: Another route is tried until a successful transaction is made.
wrong_answers:
  - The transaction is cancelled and the funds are returned to the sender.
  - The transaction is put on hold until sufficient liquidity is available.
  - The transaction is automatically rerouted to a channel with sufficient liquidity.
explanation: |
  In the Lightning Network, if a transaction attempt fails due to insufficient
  liquidity in a channel, the node will try another route. This process continues
  until a successful transaction is made. This mechanism ensures that transactions
  can be completed even if the initially chosen route does not have enough liquidity.
