question: Why is a forced closure more risky in terms of fees and possible validation by miners?
answer: Because the fees were decided when the transaction was created in the past and the network has changed since then.
wrong_answers:
  - Because the fees are always higher in a forced closure.
  - Because miners are less likely to validate a forced closure.
  - Because the fees are unpredictable in a forced closure.
explanation: |
  In a forced closure, the fees were decided when the transaction was created
  in the past. The network has changed since then, so the protocol defaults to fees
  5 times higher than the current ones when the transaction was created. This makes
  forced closure more risky in terms of fees and possible validation by miners.
