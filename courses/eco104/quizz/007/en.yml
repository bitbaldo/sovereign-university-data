explanation: |
  When central banks decide to print money, they canâ€™t simply create more value. 
  For this newly printed money to be worth something, its value must come from the 
  previous currency holders.
  Think of the money supply as a pizza, and imagine it cut into four slices. 
  Doubling the money supply would not be equivalent to doubling the amount of pizza. 
  Instead, it would be equivalent to cutting those four slices in half to create 
  eight slices. We have not gained any additional pizza. We just have more slices, 
  each smaller in size. Therefore, when we print more money, we devalue the money 
  that is already in existence.
