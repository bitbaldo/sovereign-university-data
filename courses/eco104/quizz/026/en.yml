question: What is the blockchain trilemma in the realm of cryptocurrencies? 
answer: The trade-off between scalability, security, and decentralisation in cryptocurrencies 
wrong_answers:
  - A characteristic of Bitcoin that prioritises decentralisation and security over scalability
  - The difficulty in determining the trajectory and values of cryptocurrencies
  - The limitation of Bitcoin's technology in comparison to other cryptocurrencies
explanation: |
  The concept of the blockchain trilemma is the idea that cryptocurrencies 
  must prioritise two out of three important characteristics; scalability, 
  security, and decentralisation. Bitcoin prioritises decentralisation and security, 
  which affects its scalability, but it still achieves it through alternative means.
