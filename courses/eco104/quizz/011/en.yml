question: What distinguishes Bitcoin from traditional currencies controlled by central banks or governments? 
answer: All of them
wrong_answers:
  - Bitcoin requires collaboration among miners, nodes, and developers
  - Bitcoin allows anyone to participate in the network and perform key roles
  - Bitcoin relies on a decentralised system of consensus
explanation: |
  What distinguishes Bitcoin from traditional fiat currencies is that it's a 
  collaborative effort between three essential roles and the community.
  Nodes ensure the integrity and security of the network by serving as gatekeepers.
  Miners are responsible for processing transactions and maintaining the blockchain.
  Developers are highly skilled members of the Bitcoin community who work together 
  to maintain and improve the software that powers the network.
  The community, through the use of bitcoin, is what gives it value.
  Each of these roles is essential to the functionality and success of Bitcoin as a 
  digital currency. By entrusting these crucial tasks to the key players, Bitcoin can 
  operate as a decentralised, secure, transparent, and accountable medium of exchange for 
  all users, making it significantly different from the centralised currencies we use today.
