question: Why is it far harder to purchase a house today than in the 1980s? 
answer: Suppressed interest rates make debt more enticing and inflation 
wrong_answers:
  - Inflation and rental rates 
  - The rising cost of living and population growth
  - Lack of properties and suppressed interest rates making debt more enticing
explanation: |
  While inflation is devaluing our currencyâ€™s purchasing power, making it 
  harder to save, suppressed interest rates are making debt consumption 
  more enticing. When the cost-of-capital is so cheap, people borrow beyond 
  their means, funnelling more capital into assets, and driving up prices.
