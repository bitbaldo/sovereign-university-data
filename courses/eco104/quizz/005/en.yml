wrong_answers:
  - Inflation increases purchasing power as wages rise faster than prices.
  - Inflation has no effect on purchasing power.
  - Inflation only affects the purchasing power of those who invest in financial markets.

  Inflation leads to a persistent increase in consumer prices, eroding the purchasing 
  power of wage earners as their wages typically lag behind the true rate of inflation.
  This makes it difficult for wage earners to achieve their long-term savings goals
  and maintain their standard of living.
