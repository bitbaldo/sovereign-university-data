question: Why is the argument that bitcoin is worthless because it is not backed by anything flawed? 
answer: Value is subjective and based on people's beliefs and experiences. 
wrong_answers:
  - Bitcoin is backed by gold, which gives it inherent value.
  - Bitcoin's value is determined by its scarcity and security features.
  - Bitcoin's worth is based on its acceptance by governments and banks.
explanation: |
  Value is subjective and in the eye of the beholder. Bitcoin is valuable 
  because people believe it to be so, just like art can be valuable despite 
  being made of canvas and paint. The argument that currency must be backed by 
  something of value is inaccurate, as the value of fiat currencies like the US 
  dollar is based on trust and belief as well.
