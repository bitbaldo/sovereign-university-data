wrong_answers:
  - It allows for reversing from an address to the public key.
  - It saves space in the blocks.
  - It is easier to remember than a public key.
explanation: |
  The primary reason for using a receiving address instead of a public
  key in Bitcoin transactions is to reduce the size of the public key information,
  which initially is 512 bits. This is not to save space in the blocks, but to make
  the transaction data more manageable.
