question: What is the equation of the secp256k1 curve used in Bitcoin?
answer: "y\xB2 = x\xB3 + 7 modulo n"
wrong_answers:
  - "y\xB2 = x\xB3 + ax + b"
  - "y\xB2 = x\xB3 + 7 modulo p"
  - "y\xB2 = x\xB3 + ax + b modulo n"
explanation: |
  "The secp256k1 curve used in Bitcoin is defined by the parameters a=0\
  \ and b=7, and its equation is y\xB2 = x\xB3 + 7 modulo n, where n represents the\
  \ prime number that determines the order of the curve."
