question: What is the size of a compressed public key in Bitcoin?
answer: 264 bits
wrong_answers:
  - 520 bits
  - 128 bits
  - 256 bits
explanation: |
  In Bitcoin, a raw public key occupies 520 bits. However, thanks to the
  symmetry of the elliptic curve used, we can compress the public key to reduce its
  size from 520 to 264 bits.
