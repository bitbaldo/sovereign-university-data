question: What is the role of the elliptic curve in generating public and private
  keys?
answer: It is used to generate secure public and private keys.
wrong_answers:
  - It is used to encrypt the keys.
  - It is used to store the keys.
  - It is used to transmit the keys.
explanation: |
  The elliptic curve is a mathematical construct used in the generation
  of secure public and private keys. A random number, often called a nonce, is chosen
  as the private key and used in the equation of the elliptic curve to generate the
  corresponding public key.
