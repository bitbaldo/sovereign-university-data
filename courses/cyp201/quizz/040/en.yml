question: What is the significance of using a unique nonce in the ECDSA algorithm?
answer: It helps to avoid security attacks.
wrong_answers:
  - It increases the speed of the algorithm.
  - It reduces the computational complexity.
  - It is required for the algorithm to function.
explanation: |
  The use of a unique nonce in the ECDSA algorithm is crucial for maintaining
  security. Reusing a nonce can lead to vulnerabilities, as demonstrated by the PlayStation
  3 hack, which was compromised due to nonce reuse.
