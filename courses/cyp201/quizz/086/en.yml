question: What is the result of the HMAC SHA-512 algorithm?
answer: A 512-bit number, divided into two parts; the leftmost 256 bits represent the master private key, while the rightmost 256 bits represent the master chain code.
wrong_answers:
  - A 256-bit number that represents the master private key.
  - A 256-bit number that represents the master chain code.
  - A 512-bit number that represents the seed.
