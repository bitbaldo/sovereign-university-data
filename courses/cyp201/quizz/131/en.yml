wrong_answers:
  - It increases the size of the address.
  - It encrypts the address for security purposes.
  - It allows for error correction in the address.
explanation: |
  Expanding the HRP involves encoding each letter in base 2, taking the

  first three bits of each character by inserting a separator 0, and then concatenating

  the last five bits of each character. This process reinforces the checksum.'
