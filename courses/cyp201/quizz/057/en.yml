question: What is the main challenge in generating random numbers on computers for
  Bitcoin transactions?
answer: The results obtained are not truly random.
wrong_answers:
  - The process is too complex for most users.
  - It requires a lot of computational power.
  - It is not compatible with all types of computers.
explanation: |
  Computers follow set algorithms, which makes it difficult to generate
  truly random numbers. This is a significant challenge in cryptography, where randomness
  is crucial for the security of private keys and Bitcoin transactions.
