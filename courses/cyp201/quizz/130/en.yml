question: What is the difference between addresses starting with bc1q and bc1p in
  Bitcoin?
answer: bc1q addresses use Segwit V0, while bc1p addresses use Segwit V1.
wrong_answers:
  - bc1q addresses use Segwit V1, while bc1p addresses use Segwit V0.
  - Both bc1q and bc1p addresses use Segwit V0.
  - Both bc1q and bc1p addresses use Segwit V1.
explanation: |
  To build an address starting with bc1q, we use Segwit V0. Taproot addresses,

  on the other hand, start with bc1p because their version (Segwit V1) corresponds

  to 0+1=1, hence the use of the character p.'
