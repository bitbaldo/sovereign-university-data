question: What happens if even a slightly deviating input is given to a cryptographic
  hash function?
answer: It significantly alters the final hash.
wrong_answers:
  - It produces the same hash.
  - It causes the hash function to fail.
  - It slows down the computation of the hash.
explanation: |
  Cryptographic hash functions are designed in such a way that even a slight
  deviation in the input significantly alters the final hash. This property is crucial
  for the security of the hash function, as it makes it extremely difficult to find
  a different input that produces the same hash.
