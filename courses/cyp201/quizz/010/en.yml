question: What are the initialization vectors in the SHA-256 function processing?
answer: The first 32 bits of the decimal parts of the square roots of the first 8 prime numbers
wrong_answers:
  - The first 32 bits of the decimal parts of the cubic roots of the first 8 prime numbers
  - The first 32 bits of the decimal parts of the square roots of the first 64 prime numbers
  - The first 32 bits of the decimal parts of the cubic roots of the first 64 prime numbers
explanation: |
  In the SHA-256 function processing, the initialization vectors, from
  A to H, are the first 32 bits of the decimal parts of the square roots of the first
  8 prime numbers. These are used as basic ingredients in the cryptographic recipe.
