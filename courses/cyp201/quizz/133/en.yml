wrong_answers:
  - It is used to generate the wallet's seed.
  - It is used to derive child keys.
  - It is used to calculate the checksum.
explanation: |
  In the Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallet with BIP32, entropy plays
  a central role as it is used to generate a mnemonic phrase from a random number.
  This mnemonic phrase can then be encoded into a series of easy-to-remember words
  using the list of 2048 words provided in BIP39.
