question: What is the purpose of the second phase of preprocessing in SHA256?
answer: To add the binary representation of the initial message size, in bits
wrong_answers:
  - To add padding bits to the input
  - To separate the input into different blocks of 512-bit messages
  - To perform 64 rounds of calculation in the compression function
explanation: |
  The second phase of preprocessing in SHA256 involves adding the binary
  representation of the initial message size, in bits. This is done using the 64 reserved
  bits from the previous step.
