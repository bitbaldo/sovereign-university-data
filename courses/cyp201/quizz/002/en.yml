question: What are the four strengths a cryptographic hash function must have to be recognized as secure?
answer: Irreversibility, resistance to forgery, resistance to collisions, and resistance to second preimage.
wrong_answers:
  - Speed, efficiency, resistance to collisions, and irreversibility.
  - Resistance to collisions, resistance to forgery, scalability, and irreversibility.
  - Irreversibility, resistance to collisions, resistance to forgery, and speed.
explanation: |
  A secure cryptographic hash function must have four key strengths;
  irreversibility
  (meaning it's impossible to derive the original input from the output), resistance
  to forgery (meaning it's difficult to create a different input that produces the
  same output), resistance to collisions (meaning it's difficult to find two different
  inputs that produce the same output), and resistance to second preimage (meaning
  it's difficult to find a different input that produces the same output as a given
  input).
