question: What is the ultimate goal of a cryptographic hash function?
answer: To transform arbitrary-sized information into a fixed-size fingerprint.
wrong_answers:
  - To encrypt data for secure transmission.
  - To generate a unique key for each user.
  - To compress data for efficient storage.
explanation: |
  The ultimate goal of a cryptographic hash function is to transform
  arbitrary-sized
  information into a fixed-size fingerprint. This fingerprint is unique to the input
  data, and even a small change in the input will result in a drastically different
  fingerprint.
