question: Why are SHA0, SHA1, and MD5 considered outdated hash functions?
answer: They have lost their resistance to collisions.
wrong_answers:
  - They are too slow to compute.
  - They produce too large fingerprints.
  - They are not irreversible.
explanation: |
  SHA0, SHA1, and MD5 are considered outdated hash functions because they
  have lost their resistance to collisions. This means that it's relatively easy to
  find two different inputs that produce the same output, which is a major security
  flaw.
