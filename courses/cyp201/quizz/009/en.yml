question: What is the purpose of the padding bits in the preprocessing phase of SHA256?
answer: To make the size of the input reach a perfect multiple of 512 bits
wrong_answers:
  - To increase the size of the input to 256 bits
  - To add complexity to the input
  - To reduce the size of the input to 512 bits
explanation: |
  In the preprocessing phase of SHA256, padding bits are added to the input
  to make its size reach a perfect multiple of 512 bits. This is done to ensure that
  all the ingredients blend perfectly in the cryptographic recipe.
