question: What is the advantage of using HASH160 in the Bitcoin protocol?
answer: It allows for the security of SHA-256 while reducing the size of the fingerprint.
wrong_answers:
  - It increases the size of the fingerprint for added security.
  - It is more resistant to collisions than SHA-256.
  - It is faster to compute than SHA-256.
explanation: |
  HASH160 in the Bitcoin protocol is advantageous because it maintains
  the security of SHA-256 while reducing the size of the fingerprint. This makes it
  more efficient without compromising security.
