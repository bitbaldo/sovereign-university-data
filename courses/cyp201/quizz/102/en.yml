question: How is the child public key obtained in the derivation of child keys?
answer: The child public key is obtained by multiplying the child private key by the generator of the elliptic curve.
wrong_answers:
  - The child public key is obtained by adding the child private key to the generator of the elliptic curve.
  - The child public key is obtained by subtracting the child private key from the generator of the elliptic curve.
  - The child public key is obtained by dividing the child private key by the generator of the elliptic curve.
explanation: |
  The child public key is obtained by multiplying the child private key
  by the generator of the elliptic curve. This is part of the mathematical calculations
  used in the derivation of child keys.
