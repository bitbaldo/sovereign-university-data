wrong_answers:
  - It is used to convert a mnemonic phrase into a seed.
  - It is used to generate a fixed-size output.
  - It is used to add an additional source of entropy in key derivation.
explanation: |
  HMAC is primarily used to counter length extension attacks when deriving
  hierarchically deterministic (HD) wallets. It takes a message and a key as inputs
  and generates a fixed-size output.
