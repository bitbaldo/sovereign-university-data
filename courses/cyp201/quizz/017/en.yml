question: What is the main advantage of the SHA256 hash function?
answer: Its robustness to find the input from the hash, while verifying the hash for a given input is a mechanically simple action
wrong_answers:
  - Its ability to generate a 512-bit hash from a variable-sized input
  - Its use of padding bits to increase the size of the input
  - Its use of the XOR, AND, and NOT operators to process the bits
explanation: |
  The main advantage of the SHA256 hash function is its robustness to find
  the input from the hash, while verifying the hash for a given input is a mechanically
  simple action. This makes it a preferred choice for securing numerous digital systems,
  especially within the Bitcoin protocol.
