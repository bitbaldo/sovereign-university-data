question: What is the role of the XOR operator in the compression function of SHA256?
answer: To process the bits one by one according to their rank
wrong_answers:
  - To return 1 only if both operands are equal to 1
  - To return the opposite value of an operand
  - To shift the bits to the right by a chosen number
explanation: |
  In the compression function of SHA256, the XOR operator is used to process
  the bits one by one according to their rank. This is done using a truth table.
