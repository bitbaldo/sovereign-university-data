question: What is the equation that defines an elliptic curve?
answer: "y\xB2 = x\xB3 + ax + b"
wrong_answers:
  - "y\xB2 = x\xB3 + ax"
  - "y\xB2 = x\xB3 + b"
  - "y\xB2 = x\xB3 + ax - b"
explanation: |
  "An elliptic curve is defined by the equation y\xB2 = x\xB3 + ax + b.\
  \ Every point on this curve has a distinctive symmetry that is key to its usefulness\
  \ in cryptography."
