question: What is the purpose of a checksum in the generation of a mnemonic phrase
  for a Bitcoin wallet?
answer: It ensures the verification of the accuracy of the recovery phrase.
wrong_answers:
  - It generates the entropy for the wallet.
  - It determines the number of words in the recovery phrase.
  - It encrypts the recovery phrase for added security.
explanation: |
  The checksum is obtained by passing the entropy through the SHA256 function
  and retrieving the first 8 bits of the hash. Without this checksum, an error in
  the phrase could result in the creation of a different wallet and therefore the
  loss of funds.
