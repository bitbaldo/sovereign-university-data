question: What is the significance of the point at infinity in the ECDSA algorithm?
answer: If the calculated point P is the point at infinity, the signature is invalid.
wrong_answers:
  - If the calculated point P is the point at infinity, the signature is valid.
  - The point at infinity is used to calculate the nonce.
  - The point at infinity is used to encrypt the keys.
explanation: |
  In the ECDSA algorithm, if the calculated point P on the elliptic curve
  is the point at infinity, the signature is considered invalid. This is one of the
  checks performed during the validation of a digital signature.
