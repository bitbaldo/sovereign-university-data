question: Why is the HMAC SHA-512 algorithm used in the creation of the master private key and the master chain code?
answer: Because the SHA-512 function was not initially implemented in the Bitcoin protocol.
wrong_answers:
  - Because it is the only algorithm that can generate a 512-bit number.
  - Because it is the most secure algorithm.
  - Because it is the easiest algorithm to use.
explanation: |
  Initially, the SHA-512 function was not implemented in the Bitcoin protocol,
  which is why HMAC SHA-512 is used. This algorithm requires a message and a key to
  generate a result.
