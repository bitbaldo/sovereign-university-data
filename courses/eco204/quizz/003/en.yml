explanation: |
  In 1933, the US government seized citizens'' gold. Then in 1934, they
  revalued the price of gold to $35 per ounce, instead of $20.67. Essentially, the
  government devalued the dollar that people owned. By buying gold from the population
  at $20.67 per ounce in 1933, and then revaluing the price of gold in 1934, the government
  made a substantial profit while devaluing its citizens'' savings.'
