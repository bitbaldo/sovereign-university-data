wrong_answers:
  - An increase in the money supply leads to deflation.
  - An increase in the money supply has no impact on inflation or deflation.

explanation: |
  The chapter explains that in a fixed money supply system, an increase
  in production should theoretically lead to deflation, i.e., a decrease in prices,
  as there would be more goods and services available. However, in the current fiat
  monetary system, an increase in the money supply cancels out the potential deflation
  caused by an increase in production.
