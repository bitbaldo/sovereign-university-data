Welcome to the Cubo+ development courses for Bitcoin!

Over the next 20 hours, you will dive deep into the BTC and LN protocols. This course is designed for programmers who want to start working in the BTC ecosystem and are seeking a solid understanding of the different technology stacks of BTC and LN.

The videos were recorded live during the CUBO+ 2023 bootcamp in El Salvador and succeeded in bringing together world-renowned teachers. This course was offered for free thanks to the generosity of Fulgure Venture and the collaborative efforts of the teachers, the Bitcoin office, DecouvreBitcoin, and many other actors.

Filippo and Mario provide an introductory talk on CUBO+, setting the stage for the comprehensive learning journey that awaits. They discuss the structure of the courses, the learning outcomes, and how these will empower students in the Bitcoin development space.

### Objectives

The course aims to equip participants with a deep understanding of Bitcoin's underlying principles, practical development skills, and the ability to navigate and contribute to the Bitcoin ecosystem effectively. Through a blend of theoretical knowledge and practical exercises, students will master the essentials of Bitcoin security, the intricacies of its software stack, and the mechanisms of its governance.

### Prerequisite

Participants are expected to bring a strong sense of curiosity, an eagerness to learn at a professional level, and some foundational knowledge in development. While a detailed background in Bitcoin is not required, a basic understanding of coding principles and an openness to engaging with complex technical concepts are essential for making the most of the accelerator.

## Why Bitcoin
<chapterId>89a0aa8b-90bd-58b2-82b3-bc5e1f82eaeb</chapterId>

### Why El salvador needs Bitcoin

![video](https://www.youtube.com/live/In8BJ3VlaM8?feature=share)

The first lecture ‘Why El Salvador needs Bitcoin’ provides an overview of: the Bitcoin protocol and its roots, the cypherpunk movement, and the importance of Bitcoin as a tool of freedom (uncensored money, financial inclusion, and other related topics).

### Cyperpunk movement and austrian economics

![video](https://youtube.com/live/KIaC31YQLBA)

In our second lecture 'Cypherpunk movement and Austrian Economics', we delved deeper into the Cypherpunk philosophy introduced by Rikki in the previous lecture.

Also, our discussion centered on the Austrian School of Economics, which distinguishes itself from the current financial system (Keynesian Economics).
We explored concepts such as scarcity, time preference, durability and saving, which Saifedean will delve into further. To prepare for his lecture, I recommend reading The Bitcoin Standard (you can find it in 'Additional Resources'), or at least a few chapters.

It is important to note that the first module, 'Why Bitcoin', was necessary to comprehend the roots and goals before moving on to 'How Bitcoin', where we will discover the Bitcoin's technological stack and tradeoffs early developers made in the protocol.
Here is the link, enjoy!
