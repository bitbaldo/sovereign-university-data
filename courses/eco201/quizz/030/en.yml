question: What is the implication of the sequential nature of human action on production activities?
answer: Any production detour, i.e., any lengthening of the production structure, requires prior saving.
wrong_answers:
  - The sequential nature of human action has no implication on production activities.
  - The sequential nature of human action implies that production activities must be carried out in a specific order.
  - The sequential nature of human action implies that production activities must be carried out simultaneously.
explanation: |
  Due to the sequential nature of human action, these intertemporal choices
  always have implications for the action sequence. In other words, the short-term
  actions one takes are subordinate to the long-term goals one sets, and one's short-term
  actions will influence what one can do in the future. The implication of this obvious
  point concerning production activities is that any production detour, i.e., any
  lengthening of the production structure, requires prior saving.
