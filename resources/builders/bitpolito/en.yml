   BitPolito is a student team at the Politecnico di Torino that has rapidly established itself as one of Italy's leading Bitcoin initiatives. The mission is to bridge academia and the Bitcoin industry. In the four years since its foundation, BitPolito has experienced significant growth and remains dedicated to fostering a deeper understanding and awareness of Bitcoin.
   
   Focusing on both technological and social aspects, while avoiding investment topics, BitPolito's activities range from computer science and mathematical R&D to education through various courses and events. The team publishes educational content that combines a scientific approach with a youthful style, boasting over 6,000 followers across all social platforms.

   Among its educational initiatives, the most successful is 'BitGeneration', a series of lectures for high schools that provides a solid overview of Bitcoin. Additionally, BitPolito promotes internal training, enabling its members to enhance their knowledge and connect with companies in the sector. The team actively contributes to FOSS projects in the Bitcoin space, offering hands-on experience with challenging real-world projects. Moreover, members have easier access to external Bitcoin educational programs, corporate thesis, internships and job opportunities.
   
   Drawing inspiration from the 'Cypherpunk' movement, BitPolito shares values of freedom, privacy, and open-source principles. The team collaborates with institutional entities, businesses, and organizations in both the public and private sectors, advocating for the free and responsible use of technology.
   
   Currently, BitPolito consists of around 50 active members, mainly students from the Polytechnic, but also young people from diverse backgrounds. More than 120 individuals have been involved with BitPolito, with 10 now working in the Bitcoin industry. The team aims to increase its international presence while continuing to make a significant impact locally.
